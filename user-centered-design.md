User Centered Design Reflection:

Which principles seem most important to you?

Right out of the gate, point number one: design for the users and their tasks.
To me, this seems like it should be at the base of your design decisions. You ask yourself the question, "Is this thing (insert anything here) what my users want, and/or is it useful for them to do what they need to do?" I feel like starting from anywhere other than that question is pretty unwise. 
After you have thought about your user, and what they want, I think you'd then want to focus on point number nine: be helpful. It's cheating a little bit, because it is a very broad statement, but I took it to mean this: Now that you know what your user wants and/or needs, do whatever you can to give that to them, in a way that is useful, not burdensome.


Are there any with which you disagree or feel are unimportant or less important?

I feel like several of the points in this article overlap with each other, ie: 4 Reduce unnecessary mental effort by the user. That same statement could easily also cover: 3 Use simple and natural dialogue, 5 Provide adequate feedback, 6 Provide adequate navigation mechanisms and 8 Present information clearly. And really, ALL of these points could fit under my aforementioned favourite all-purpose statement, "Be Helpful". So, it's not so much that I think these points are unimportant, they are all good principles. However, I think a little more work could be put into keeping them distinctive and actionable.


Are there any which surprised you?

I thought that number seven: Let the user drive was interesting. It reminds me of that famous Sid Meier mentality, he believes that the player should always be having more fun than the computer. Let the user drive is kind of a different way of expressing that same message, it's like saying, "I am going to give you the tools and then let you enjoy using them".
