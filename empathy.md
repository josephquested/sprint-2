EMPATHY

Give an example of a time in your life where you've shown empathy for another:

I had to fire somebody at work once. Well, I guess you would say "redundancy", technically, but there isn't much solace to be found in semantics when you're losing your job. I tried to figure out the way I was going to do it, and initially I was opting for very sympathetic methods, (sympathetic as defined in the Bren√© Brown on Empathy video). I thought maybe I would tell them about how it's not so bad, because she will probably get another job soon - the cliche of "you'll land on your feet" etc. Then I thought maybe I would describe the situation from my position. Explain that this was difficult for me, and it was just something I had to do for financial reasons.. But then I realised that is exactly the wrong way to approach empathy, by saying, "Damn, you're getting fired, here's why this is hard for ME". In the end I basically just said that I was sorry, and that I know this sucks, and that I hope she doesn't take it as a reflection of her work ethic; which was good. (That part was somewhat of a white lie, she could definitely have been a more pro-active worker, but it's not exactly the right time to rub that in).

Was it difficult?

Yes and no. Having the intention to approach the situation empathetically was easy, but actually determining the best way to phrase it was difficult. Especially because it's such a tense situation as it is, any little verbal mistake could have been disastrous.  

Was it worth it? Why or why not?

It was definitely worth it. Even after my attempt to engineer as empathetic a firing as possible (which I think was successful), she was still very upset.  So had I been more callus about the situation, I can't even imagine how devastated she would have been. 

Thanks for making me re-live that awkward memory.
