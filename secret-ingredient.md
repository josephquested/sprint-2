SOCIAL CAPITAL

What social capital is?

I think it's nuts that people are only just starting to really pay attention to the concept of social capital. I mean, to a certain extent, it has always been on peoples minds. Because it is one of those "soft science" concepts that we employ almost subconsciously, without necessarily needing to vocalise our understanding of it. However, just leaving it to happen on its own doesn't give it the emphasis it deserves. It's easy enough to say, "Yes, our company will function better if the employees communicate and trust each other", but it's another thing to say, "We are going to actively pursue a social capital rich environment". 

This specific article was a pretty good overview. It was reminiscent of that great chapter in Malcolm Gladwell's 'The Tipping Point' where he talks about the mysterious '150 Rule'. In the book, he postulates that when a group exceeds 150 members, (be it a company, a church, or a tribe, etc), things naturally just start to fall apart. This is a classic example of social capital at work. As soon as your gang grows past a certain point, seemingly 150, it is just too hard to keep the social capital accounts adequately stocked up. Gladwell theorises that this an stems from an innate human quality; we apparently can't keep more than 150 people and relationships in our head at once. He specifically singles out a company with an excellent culture for social capital, the GORE company, if I remember correctly. They have an interesting business model; one that follows the '150 Rule' very slavishly. As soon as a factory in their company surpasses 150 employees, they open a new factory. While this might seem hopelessly inefficient, it has worked VERY well for them. It helps keep the needed levels of social capital in balance, and keeps their workers focused and social.

How important do you think trust and empathy are to your success in life?

They're definitely pretty important in my life. I've got two three year old children, and things get very awful, very quickly if I am not empathetic with them. And in turn, when I don't show them empathy, they distrust me. It's a beautiful or painful cycle, really. You are empathetic towards people you trust, and they trust you because you are empathetic. Round and around. 

In a professional context trust is just as important too.. You need to have a mutually trusting relationship with your employer, or things quickly dissolve into shit. I have definitely worked in environments like that before. The workers feel like the boss isn't treating them fairly; trust breaks down. Then, if the boss proposes an idea, it gets shot down regardless of its content. Once you lose trust in somebody it's hard to respect their ideas, even if they're great ideas.
