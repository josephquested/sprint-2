VISUALIZING LINKS

What is the rule for underlining text that is not a link?
Don't do it! People have an automatic assumption that underlined things are clickable, because even if links aren't underlined on your website, they are almost everywhere else.

How should the unvisited link color compare to the visited link color in terms of: Brightness, Hue, Visibility to color-blind users?
Unvisited links should be brighter and more saturated than visited links. Although they should be similar colours, ie, both blue, visited links should have that "used" feeling to them. Kind of worn out. Probably avoid using green and red too, because they are tend to cause the most common for people with colour-blindness.

What is a "perceived affordance"? 
Perceived affordance refers to the attributes of something, in regards to what that thing might do. In this context, an example would be blue links. We have been trained, after years of visiting websites with blue links, that blue text probably indicates clickability. In the same way, you might say that emails with an ALL CAPS SUBJECT LINE!!! have a strong perceived affordance of trashability.

When can you safely eliminate underlines for links?
In situations where it is already very implicit that you are looking at a link. IE: navigation bars or link lists.

Should you use blue for text? Why or why not?
No! As I mentioned above, we have been trained so well that  blue == link. Just don't mess with the preconceptions that people almost certainly have. 

If for some shocking reason, your contextual links are not underlined (horrors!), what can you do to improve link discovery by users?
The obvious solution is different coloured link text. Even further than that though, use some kind of cursor hover action. Maybe an underline appears under the link when you hover over it, or failing that, a good link title. Speaking of which..

What are link titles and how might you use them?
Link titles are little popups that appear from links when you hover your cursor over them. They are useful to give the user some idea of where the link is going to take them, and eliminate a little bit of the anxiety that might come along with clinking a link. They also help a user identify links, as mentioned above.
