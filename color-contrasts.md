#f08080 / #fffacd FAIL

This was kind of surprising, I thought these two grays were close, but not upsettingly close.

#b0e0e6 / #191970 PASS

#ffff00 / #000000 PASS

#98fb98 / #ff4500 FAIL 
This one surprised me a little bit, I thought it was a shockingly ugly colour pairing, but not really unreadable.
